This simulates the game of Connect Four. It can be played with two human players, against an AI, or with two AIs.
To play the game, run Game.py. AIs are set to have a difficulty level, with higher levels being smarter AIs. There is no maximum level,
but the game may slow down with levels higher than 8.
